# Flappy-Bird
A simple yet fun recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game, built entirely in Java using Java Swing and AWT for graphics and event handling.
The player controls a bird that must navigate through a series of pipes without colliding with them. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes increases the score.
